# Kube CDN

Kube-CDN is a Kubernetes-native content delivery network (CDN) solution that helps optimize the delivery of web content by caching and distributing it across multiple nodes in a Kubernetes cluster. It leverages Kubernetes' native capabilities to provide a scalable and resilient CDN that integrates seamlessly with your existing Kubernetes infrastructure.

## Description

Kube-CDN is designed to improve the performance and reliability of web content delivery by distributing content across multiple cache nodes within a Kubernetes cluster. By deploying Kube-CDN, you can reduce latency and improve the loading times of your web applications. Kube-CDN utilizes custom resource definitions (CRDs) to manage CDN resources and configurations, making it easy to deploy, manage, and scale your CDN infrastructure within a Kubernetes environment. With support for automatic failover and load balancing, Kube-CDN ensures high availability and fault tolerance for your web content.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- go version v1.21.0+
- docker version 17.03+.
- kubectl version v1.11.3+.
- Access to a Kubernetes v1.11.3+ cluster.

### To Deploy on the cluster
**Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/kube-cdn:tag
```

**NOTE:** This image ought to be published in the personal registry you specified.
And it is required to have access to pull the image from the working environment.
Make sure you have the proper permission to the registry if the above commands donâ€™t work.

**Install the CRDs into the cluster:**

```sh
make install
```

**Deploy the Manager to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/kube-cdn:tag
```

> **NOTE**: If you encounter RBAC errors, you may need to grant yourself cluster-admin
privileges or be logged in as admin.

**Create instances of your solution**
You can apply the samples (examples) from the config/sample:

```sh
kubectl apply -k config/samples/
```

>**NOTE**: Ensure that the samples has default values to test it out.

### To Uninstall
**Delete the instances (CRs) from the cluster:**

```sh
kubectl delete -k config/samples/
```

**Delete the APIs(CRDs) from the cluster:**

```sh
make uninstall
```

**UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:**

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Project Distribution

Following are the steps to build the installer and distribute this project to users.

1. Build the installer for the image built and published in the registry:

```sh
make build-installer IMG=<some-registry>/kube-cdn:tag
```

NOTE: The makefile target mentioned above generates an 'install.yaml'
file in the dist directory. This file contains all the resources built
with Kustomize, which are necessary to install this project without
its dependencies.

2. Using the installer

Users can just run kubectl apply -f <URL for YAML BUNDLE> to install the project, i.e.:

```sh
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<org>/kube-cdn/<tag or branch>/dist/install.yaml
```

**NOTE:** Run `make help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
